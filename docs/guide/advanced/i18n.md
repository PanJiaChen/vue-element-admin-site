# I18n
This project is a collection of internationalized i18n solutions. Implemented via  [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n).

Since the project's ui framework uses `element`, internationalization also needs to be internationalized.
[code](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-element-admin/blob/master/src/lang/index.js).
At the same time, the current `lang` language save in the `cookie`, and the last language setting can be remembered for opening the page next time.

## Global lang
Code: [@/lang](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-element-admin/tree/master/src/lang)
Currently set English and Chinese languages.

Meanwhile, import a language package in `@/lang/index.js` for `element-ui`.

## Async lang
There are some langs that are needed for specific pages, such as the `@/views/i18n` page, you can use async lang.

```js
import local from './local'

this.$i18n.mergeLocaleMessage('en', local.en)
this.$i18n.mergeLocaleMessage('zh', local.zh)
```

## Remove i18n

In `src/main.js` remove `import i18n from './lang'` and delete `src/lang` folder.

And remove  `this.$t('route.xxxx')` in `src/layout/components/Levelbar`、`src/layout/components/SidebarItem`、`src/layout/components/TabsView` or others.
